# Seal Seals By Robely

Texture replacement that swaps the seals to be shaped like seals!

Applied to a (mostly) blank texture sheet for other mod compatibility!


## Prerequisites
Other than Balatro itself, the following tools and mods are required:

0. [Lovely (>=0.6)](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) (Lua injector, required for Steamodded)
1. [Steamodded (>=1.0.0~alpha)](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) (mod loader, required for Malverk)
2. [Malverk (>=1.0)](https://github.com/Eremel/Malverk) (texture pack manager, required for _this_ mod)

## Installation
Like any other Steamodded-based Balatro mod, put this mod in the `Mods`
directory in the Balatro `AppData` directory, alongside Steamodded and Malverk.

## Usage
Apply the textures in the Malverk `Textures` menu inside `Options`.
